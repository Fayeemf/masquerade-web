Make sure you skip a line after the header: line 4 needs to be empty. Here's the body. Here you can format your blogpost as such. Writing text will parse text. Keep writing on one line to continue a paragraph, forever, and ever, and ever, and ever...
Or start a new line for a break.

Skip a line for a line break.

Having all dashes in a line will create a vertical line.

Using asterisks will *bold text.* Using underlines will _italicize the fuck out of it._

Having a line with just a tilda will put a symbol in the middle.

Having tildas midline will ~strikethrough~ the text.
