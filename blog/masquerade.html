            "The dance beckoned to me. <i>I was at a loss;</i> all I could do once again was to throw on a mask and sway to the harmonic rhythm of society. I have come to realize <i>identity</i> is simply another <i>mask</i> to be worn. And so I will give ‘identity’ some variance, and don <b>every</b> mask. I will dance--<b>what else is there to do at a masquerade?</b>"
