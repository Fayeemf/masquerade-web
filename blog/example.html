            Hello world! This is my first blog post.
<br>
Isn't this a great templating engine?
<br>

<br>
In fact, I'm going to use <i>this</i> to write <i><b>all</b></i> of my <b>blogs</b>!

Of course, what blog would be complete without a hello world?*

Anyways, I only marked this NSFW to show how that works. But really, there's nothing NSFW about this, besides the <s>fucking amazing</s> awesome templating engine!

* Hello, World! is usually the first thing done in every language (started as a trend as the first thing to learn in a language is how to print to console/debugger/renderer/something!)
