                    <p>My life is a routine--the same repetitive, monotone existence, every day. The only escape is expression; yet, traditional forms of expression are inherently limited. Years of rules, additions, and revisions have imprisoned the unbridled creativity artisans of the past treasured. 
<br>

<br>
Fortunately, there is an art form untouched by limitation--the modern tongues: C#, Python, Javascript. The time of the romance languages is long gone; programming languages, more diverse and greater in quantity, have taken the reins.

Rather than remain in a fateful loop, I found salvation in abstract syntax. If the pen is the writer's sword, the computer is my lance. My fingers adopt a fascinating gait, striding across the keyboard, creating, deleting, painting a masterpiece with assortments of characters and colorful splendor. To dismiss programming as an unimaginative science is injustice. Code involves intricate efficiencies, graceful algorithms, and acute expressions of thought: it is a modern art.

I cherish these fleeting moments, where a tinge of color disturbs the monotone projection of life. This is the true definition of a 'maker'--an innovator who seeks out the creative beauty within disruption. I have embraced this identity--I have chosen, rather than been chosen, to undergo a metamorphosis. I have unchained the child inside me that seeks wonder and amusement, the spark of curiosity that yearns to be kindled into a flame. Distortion becomes disruption as I aim to achieve for the sake of satisfaction--to create for the sake of creativity. With the single-minded goal of innovation, I have finished my cycle; I choose not to labor, but to <i>make</i>.
